# ERC_TOKEN


The ECT token is an ERC-20 compliant token that supports basic functionalities such as transferring tokens between accounts, approving third-party spenders, and querying balances and allowances. It enables seamless integration with decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. The token follows the standard ERC-20 methods: transfer, approve, transferFrom, and allows users to view token details, such as name, symbol, total supply, and individual balances.
